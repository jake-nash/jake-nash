# Hi, I'm Jacob Nash

I'm in my final semester of earning my BS in Computer Science from the College of Charleston, where I will graduate this December _Summa cum laude_. I'm currently also in the process of finding a job for after graduation.

I don't have much code to show here, but feel free to look around, and if you have any questions please email me at nashjr@g.cofc.edu. 

Thanks!
